            <h1>culture</h1>
            <p>
                The culture of Sri Lanka has been influenced by many factors but has managed to retain much of its ancient aspects. Mostly it has been influenced by its long history
                and its Buddhist heritage. The country has a rich artistic tradition, embracing the fine arts, including music, dance, and visual arts. Sri Lankan lifestyle is reflected 
                in the cuisine, festivals, and sports. South Indian influences are visible in many aspects. There are some influences from colonization by the Portuguese, the Dutch, 
                and the British. Sri Lankan culture is best known abroad for its cricket, food, holistic medicine,
                religious icons like the Buddhist flag, and cultural exports such as tea, cinnamon, and gems. Sri Lankan culture is diverse, as it varies from region to region.

            <h2>Religion</h2>
            <p>                
                The social landscape of the country tends to show an association between ethnicity and religion.
                The Sinhalese majority generally follows Buddhism, which has seen the faith gain special status 
                over other religions despite not being the official religion of the country. Those who identify as Hindu tend to be ethnic Tamils,
                while those who identify as Muslim are generally Sri Lankan Moors. Christians are typically Burghers. 
                Identifying with a particular religion is not necessarily connected to one ethnicity. For example, 
                there are some Sri Lankans who identify as Christian that are of Sinhalese or Tamil ethnicity. 
                Moreover, it is common to find the various religions coexisting. Buddhists may visit Hindu temples to pay homage to the Buddha, 
                and churches may be near mosques
