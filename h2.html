              <p class="card-body">this temple is a world-renowned destination of worship. UNESCO designated the temple, which is visited daily by hundreds of local and foreign devotees and tourists, as a world historic site in 1988.
                The temple, which has a great deal of religious significance for Buddhists all over the world, also has a great deal of cultural significance. The construction is of a unique Kandyan architectural style, combining elements from the "Dalada Mandira" shrines that previously housed the Sacred Tooth Relic in various kingdoms.The Sacred Tooth Relic Temple is located in Kandy, near the ancient Royal Palace to the north and the woodland reserve known as "Udawaththa Kelaya" to the east. To the south, the famed Kandy Lake is known as "Kiri Muhuda," and to the west, "Natha & Paththini Devala." Intricate carvings in gold, silver, bronze, and ivory embellish the temple.</p>
            <p>The Sacred Tooth Relic of Gautama Buddha is finally resting at Kandy, Sri Lanka. During the reign of King Keerthi Sri Meghavarna, Princess Hemamala and Prince Dantha carried the sacred relic to Sri Lanka from the ancient Indian city of Kalinga (Kithsirimevan 301 -328). It became a symbol of Sri Lankan kings, and it was carefully kept in an unique shrine within the royal palace's precincts, wherever the capital was located. The ancient capitals of Anuradapura, Pollonnaruwa, Dambadeniya, Yapahuwa, Kurunegala, Kotte, and Gampola all include ruins of similar structures. While the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic continues to be the greatest shrine in Kandy, the last Kingdom, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic continues to be the most venerated shrine in the Buddhist world.</p>
             <p>The three primary custodians of the Sacred Tooth Relic, the most Venerable Mahanayake theros of Malwatta and Asgiriya chapters, and the lay custodian, the Diyawadana Nilame, continue to protect the Sacred Tooth Relic and conduct religious rites without interruption to this day.</p>
