              <p>At 2,244 meters, Adam's Peak is Sri Lanka's fourth tallest mountain, located 40 kilometers northeast of Ratnapura.
                The Sri Pada, also known as Adam's Peak, is a significant pilgrimage site. The footprint on the peak, according to Buddhists, is that of Lord Buddha himself. Despite the fact that climbing the summit takes about 5 hours, members of numerous religions do so on a daily basis to seek blessings. Samanala Kanda, or Butterfly Mountain, is another name for the mountain.</p>
                <p>There are no mountains of equal magnitude anywhere near Adam's Peak, which is mostly surrounded by forested hills. In 2011, the Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, which includes Adam's Peak, Horton Plains National Park, and the Knuckles Range in Sri Lanka's Central Highlands, was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
                <p>Hatton is accessible via the Highland Railway line as well as major highways, whereas Ratnapura and Kuruwita are only accessible via major highways.
                    Six routes lead to Adam's Peak: Hatton-Nallathanni, Ratnapura-Palabaddala, Kuruwita-Erathna, Murraywatte, Mookuwatte, and Malimboda.
                    The Hatton-Nallathanni and Ratnapura-Palabaddala routes are the most popular because of the stunning sights and postcard-worthy landscapes that can be found along them.</p>
